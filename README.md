 BP Summer Project:  
	The Growth of Bacterial Biofilms on Graphene 
University of Manchester 

•	Developed an agent-based physics simulation of the bacterial adhesion process, which included electrostatic and hydrodynamic interactions between spherical and non-spherical particles moving in Brownian motion. The hydrodynamics were modelled using lubrication theory and electrostatic interactions were described by DLVO theory. 

•	Compared results of the simulation to an experimental data of bacterial adhesion process. 

•	Modeling physical processes, implementing collision detection and numerical integration algorithms, computing inter-particle forces by solving linear systems in MATLAB and C++.
